Hello everyone,

I have decided to create a website for a fictional photographer called Lea Marie. 
The content, including the name, images, and information about the photographer, is entirely fictional and intended solely for educational and illustrative purposes. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

I have very little html and css experience but willing to learn more.

Cheers,

Iria
